# ✅ Billable Hours Implementation - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented billable hours calculation that reconciles with cost estimates. The hours now match when you back-calculate from the cost.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Core Calculation** (`app/page.tsx` lines 659-674)

Added new metrics to the calculation:
```typescript
const hourlyRate = settings.contributorCost / settings.hoursPerDay;
const billableHours = totalCost / hourlyRate;
const productiveHours = adjustedEffort;
const overheadHours = billableHours - productiveHours;
const efficiencyPercent = productiveHours / billableHours;
```

**Returns:**
- `billableHours` - Hours that match cost calculation
- `productiveHours` - Productive hours after AI optimization
- `overheadHours` - Overhead (meetings, coordination, etc.)
- `efficiencyPercent` - Productive/billable ratio

---

### 2. **Metrics Panel Display** (`components/MetricsPanel.tsx` lines 246-265)

**Client-Safe Mode:**
```
Project Hours: 196 hrs
```

**Internal Mode:**
```
Billable Hours: 196 hrs
  140 productive hrs
  (71% efficiency)
```

Shows both metrics with efficiency percentage in internal mode.

---

### 3. **PDF Export** (`components/ExportPanel.tsx` lines 179-186)

**Client-Safe Mode:**
```
Project Hours: 196 hrs
```

**Internal Mode:**
```
Project Hours: 196 hrs
Productive Hours: 140 hrs (71% efficiency)
```

---

### 4. **CSV Export** (`utils/export/csv.ts` lines 108-111)

**Client-Safe Mode:**
```
Project Hours: 196.0
```

**Internal Mode:**
```
Project Hours: 196.0
Productive Hours: 140.0 (71% efficiency)
```

## How It Works

### Before (Broken Math)
```
Adjusted Effort: 140 hrs (productive)
Total Cost: $26,160
Hourly Rate: $133/hr

Back-calculation: $26,160 ÷ $133 = 196 hrs ❌
But showed: 140 hrs
Gap: 56 hrs (40%)
```

### After (Math Reconciles)
```
Billable Hours: 196 hrs
  ├─ Productive: 140 hrs (71% efficiency)
  └─ Overhead: 56 hrs (29%)
Total Cost: $26,160
Hourly Rate: $133/hr

Verification: 196 hrs × $133 = $26,160 ✓
```

## The Math

### Calculation Flow
```
1. Calculate cost (existing, unchanged):
   totalCost = days × dailyRate × teamSize

2. Calculate billable hours (NEW):
   hourlyRate = dailyRate ÷ hoursPerDay
   billableHours = totalCost ÷ hourlyRate

3. Calculate efficiency (NEW):
   productiveHours = adjustedEffort (existing)
   efficiencyPercent = productiveHours ÷ billableHours
```

### Example
```
Settings:
- Daily Rate: $800
- Hours/Day: 6
- Total Cost: $26,160

Calculations:
- Hourly Rate: $800 ÷ 6 = $133.33/hr
- Billable Hours: $26,160 ÷ $133.33 = 196 hrs
- Productive Hours: 140 hrs (from AI calculation)
- Efficiency: 140 ÷ 196 = 71%
- Overhead: 196 - 140 = 56 hrs (29%)
```

## What's Included in Each Metric

### Billable Hours (196 hrs)
**Total project time including:**
- Productive development time
- Meetings and planning
- Team coordination
- Communication overhead
- Breaks and context switching
- Weekend calendar days

### Productive Hours (140 hrs)
**Pure development time:**
- Hands-on coding
- After AI productivity gains
- Actual "keyboard time"
- Excludes overhead

### Overhead Hours (56 hrs)
**Non-productive time:**
- Team meetings
- Daily standups
- Sprint planning
- Code reviews
- Context switching
- Account management

---

## Display Strategy

### Client-Safe Mode
**Simple, clean display:**
- Shows only "Project Hours" (billable)
- Hides internal details
- Math reconciles with cost

### Internal Mode
**Full transparency:**
- Shows "Billable Hours" (primary)
- Shows "Productive Hours" (secondary)
- Shows efficiency percentage
- Reveals AI productivity impact

---

## Verification

### Test the Math
```javascript
// Given
const cost = 26160;
const dailyRate = 800;
const hoursPerDay = 6;

// Calculate
const hourlyRate = dailyRate / hoursPerDay;  // $133.33
const billableHours = cost / hourlyRate;      // 196 hrs

// Verify
const backCalc = billableHours * hourlyRate;  // $26,160 ✓
```

### Check the Display
1. Open Scope Playground
2. Add stories to matrix
3. Check metrics panel:
   - Client mode: "Project Hours: X"
   - Internal mode: "Billable Hours: X" with details
4. Export PDF:
   - Verify hours match cost calculation
5. Export CSV:
   - Verify "Project Hours" column

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] View metrics in client-safe mode (should show "Project Hours")
- [ ] View metrics in internal mode (should show "Billable Hours" with details)
- [ ] Export PDF in client mode (should show "Project Hours")
- [ ] Export PDF in internal mode (should show both metrics)
- [ ] Export CSV and verify hours column
- [ ] Back-calculate: Cost ÷ Hourly Rate = Billable Hours ✓
- [ ] Verify efficiency percentage makes sense (60-80% typical)
