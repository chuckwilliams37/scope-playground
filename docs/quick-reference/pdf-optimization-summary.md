# PDF Optimization Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully optimized PDF generation in `components/ExportPanel.tsx`:

### 1. Enabled PDF Compression (Line 66)
```typescript
compress: true
```

### 2. Added Image Compression Function (Lines 115-131)
- Reduces canvas to 75% size
- Converts to JPEG at 85% quality
- Uses high-quality smoothing

### 3. Reduced html2canvas Scale (Lines 368, 422)
```typescript
scale: 0.9  // Was 1.5
```

### 4. Changed PNG to JPEG (Lines 380, 386, 434, 440)
```typescript
const imgData = compressImage(canvas, 0.85);
pdf.addImage(imgData, 'JPEG', ...);
```

### 5. Reduced Image Width (Lines 381, 435)
```typescript
const imgWidth = 150;  // Was 170
```
