"Task","86ac1zncm","Scheduler Notification & Assignment","defined","As a Ready Roofer special projects scheduler I would like to receive notifications via email & SMS when new special projects are created so that I can schedule a crew and add notes for that special project / job.

As scheduler, get notified on new job.

Issue: jobs on calendar are currently all jobs, not specifically assigned jobs. 
Problem to solve: Efficiently finding updated jobs when doing sync.
